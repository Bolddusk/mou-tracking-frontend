# Step 12A — Matchmaking: Sector Lead Review (Shortlist / Reject)

**Backend:** `http://localhost:5000`  
**Base path:** `/api/matchmaking`  
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

> **Context:** This is the **new matchmaking flow** — separate from legacy `/api/proposals`.  
> Party A already submitted via Step 12 (Pakistan proposal, no Party B / MOU).  
> Sector Lead now **evaluates** → shortlist or reject.

## Migration (run once)

```bash

npm run db:seed:matchmaking-pakistan
```

## Status flow (this step)

```
draft → submitted → shortlisted
                 ↘ rejected
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Party A still editing (Sector Lead cannot see) |
| `submitted` | Waiting for Sector Lead evaluation |
| `shortlisted` | Sector Lead approved for next step (forward to China — coming next) |
| `rejected` | Sector Lead rejected (comment required) |

## Frontend UI suggestions

### Sector Lead dashboard tabs

| Tab | API call |
|-----|----------|
| Pending | `GET .../sector-lead?status=submitted` |
| Shortlisted | `GET .../sector-lead?status=shortlisted` |
| Rejected | `GET .../sector-lead?status=rejected` |
| All | `GET .../sector-lead` |

### Detail page actions (only if `status === 'submitted'`)

- **Shortlist** button → `PATCH .../shortlist`
- **Reject** button → modal with required comment → `PATCH .../reject`

### Important

- Use `/api/matchmaking/*` — **not** `/api/proposals/*`
- Legacy proposal approve/reject screens **do not** apply here
- After shortlist, next backend step will be **forward to China RFP** (not built yet)
